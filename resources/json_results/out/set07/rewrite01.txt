Purpose. This suite establishes a unified set of administrative, physical, and technical controls for HIPAA compliance (Privacy, Security & Breach Notification) and SOC 2 attestation (Trust Services Criteria). It defines responsibilities, minimum control requirements, operational procedures, monitoring, and evidence expectations..9

1. Purpose
   1.1 This policy sets minimum safeguards to protect Company Data, including any electronic health information handled by <CompanyName>.
   1.The objectives are to prevent unauthorized access, ensure service continuity, and promote responsible handling of sensitive information through hashing/signing where applicable, implement change detection mechanisms, and employ anti-tamper technologies.

2. Scope
   2.1 All Workforce Members must complete training; adhere to policies; report incidents promptly.
   2.2 Sections marked “HIPAA ePHI” apply where electronic protected health information is processed.

3. Governance & Roles
   3.The Board of Directors sets the tone at the top; oversees risk; approves this policy suite.
   3.The Privacy Officer owns Privacy Rule; Notice of Privacy Practices; individual rights; breach notification content.
   3.3 System Owners approve access to their systems and complete user access reviews.
   3.4 All personnel complete training and report suspected incidents without delay.

4. Risk Management (Administrative)
   4.An enterprise risk analysis is conducted annually and following significant changes. The outcomes are documented in a risk register, including identified owners and their respective deadlines.
   4.2 Risks rated Critical or High are remediated on a defined timetable. High/Critical items must be remediated within 30-90 days of identification, with written business justification and CISO approval for acceptance.
   4.3 Sanctions: policy violations may lead to corrective action up to termination.

5. Access Control (Technical & Administrative)
   5.1 Data owners classify data; approve access; perform user access reviews; maintain system inventories.
   5.2 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory for administrators and remote access. (MFA for all users is recommended.)
   5.3 Sessions must lock after 20 minutes of inactivity and require re-authentication to resume.
   5.User access reviews are conducted quarterly on all systems; documentation of remediation actions must be maintained.

6. Workforce Security & Training (Administrative)
   6.Onboarding for new hires and annual refresher training in security and privacy principles must be completed by all personnel.
   6.2 Departing personnel have access revoked within 24 hours of separation. Company assets and credentials are returned or disabled.

7. Encryption & Key Management (Technical)
   7.1 Production databases and file stores containing sensitive data must be encrypted at rest using strong, industry-accepted algorithms with a minimum of 7-day patch SLAs for critical systems.
   7.Data in transit must use secure protocols (TLS 1.2+) unless exceptions have been documented for a risk review and compensating controls.
   7.Storage of keys follows an encryption standard that includes mapping to controls such as AWS Key Management Service (KMS) or Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), along with a detailed key rotation schedule and robust secret management practices.

8. Logging & Monitoring (Technical)
   8.1 Security-relevant events (authentication results, privilege changes, configuration changes, and incident indicators) are logged centrally for at least 1 year online and retained in compliance logs; alerts trigger based on predefined criteria.ronized time stamps in immutable storage for critical logs, enabling centralized analysis via SIEM systems.
   8.2 Logs are retained for at least 1 year, with restricted access and tamper-resistant storage for critical systems.
   8.The IT operations team implements technical controls such as access management, logging, backups, disaster recovery, patch management, and endpoint protection to ensure the integrity and availability of the infrastructure.

9. Incident Response (Administrative & Technical)
   9.1 Suspected security incidents are reported to Security and the Privacy Officer within 24 hours of discovery.
   9.The incident team detects, contains, eradicates, recovers, and learns from incidents, conducting tabletop exercises biannually.
   9.3 Where ePHI is involved, the Privacy Officer coordinates regulatory notifications consistent with applicable law.

10. Contingency Planning & Backups (Administrative & Technical)
   10.1 Production data is backed up quarterly and encrypted in storage and transit to the backup repository.
   10.Periodic technical and non-technical evaluations are conducted annually; outcomes and issues are documented for resolution.
   10.3 Contingency Plan (R/A): Data backup plan, disaster recovery plan, emergency mode operations. These plans define RTO/RPO for critical services and validate them annually.

11. Physical Safeguards
   11.1 Facilities housing production systems implement badge-based access control measures and utilize visitor management protocols for entry verification.
   11.2 Workstations used to access PHI employ secure screens, privacy filters, and clear desks.

12. Vendor & Third-Party Management (Organizational)
   12.3 Third-party management includes conducting thorough vetting processes for vendors handling sensitive data, ensuring compliance with established security standards.
   12.2 Business Associate Agreements are executed before any vendor handles ePHI; subcontractors must comply with the same terms as the primary vendor.

13. Data Classification & Handling
   13.1 Data is categorized (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted/ePHI) and securely disposed using secure methods such as physical destruction or encryption before reuse in non-confidential applications. Handling rules also include guidelines for media reuse with cryptographic erase to prevent data recovery.
   13.2 Personnel must access only the minimum necessary data to perform their assigned duties.

14. Secure Development & Change Management
   14.1 Changes to production services must undergo thorough security assessments and be approved by senior management before implementation.
   14.2 Changes are reviewed for potential vulnerabilities; critical flaws are addressed prior to deployment or documented with an authorized exception.
   14.3 Secrets are stored in managed vaults; direct embedding of secrets in source code is prohibited.

15. Vulnerability & Patch Management
   15.1 Regularly scan systems for vulnerabilities; triage findings and track them through remediation efforts.
   15.2 Critical vulnerabilities will be remediated within 7 days, and High within 14 days unless an approved exception exists.

16. Documentation & Retention
   16.1 Security and privacy program documentation, access review evidence, incident records, and training logs are retained for ≥6 years from creation or last effective date.
   16.This policy is reviewed annually and updated whenever there are significant changes in technology, regulations, business models, or incidents.

17. Privacy Program (Overview)
   17.1 Notices describe how personal information is collected, used, and shared; requests for access or deletion of personal information are handled in accordance with applicable laws.
   17.2 Data is retained only as long as needed for business and legal purposes, after which it is securely disposed of.

18. Enforcement
   18.Non-compliance will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination and legal remedies where applicable, which may include termination and legal remedies.
