Company Information Security & Privacy Policy (Mid-Coverage Draft) Approved By: CISO/Privacy Officer Executive Sponsor: <Executive Sponsor> Effective Date: <YYYY-MM-DD> Version: 0.9.9\n\n1. Purpose\n   1.1 This policy sets minimum safeguards to protect Company Data, including any electronic health information handled by <CompanyName>.\n   1.The objectives are to implement technical controls such as access management, logging, backups, disaster recovery, patch management, and endpoint security.\n\n2. Scope\n   2.1 Applies to all employees, contractors, and vendors who access Company systems.\n   2.2 Sections marked “ePHI” apply where electronic protected health information is processed.\n\n3.

Risk Management (Administrative)\n   4.1 An enterprise risk analysis is performed at least annually and after major changes. Results are tracked in a risk register with owners and due dates.\n   4.2 Risks rated Critical or High are remediated on a defined timetable. Risk acceptance requires written business justification and CISO approval.\n   4.3 Sanctions: policy violations may lead to corrective action up to termination.\n\n5. Access Control (Technical & Administrative)\n   5.1 Access is granted based on job duties and approved by the relevant manager and System Owner (least-privilege).\n   5.2 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory for administrators and remote access. (MFA for all users is recommended.)\n   5.3 Sessions must lock after 20 minutes of inactivity and require re-authentication to resume.\n   5.4 User access reviews are performed quarterly on high-risk systems and annually on others; remediation is documented.\n\n6.

Logging & Monitoring (Technical)\n   8.1 Security-relevant events (authentication results, privilege changes, configuration changes, and incident indicators) are logged centrally where feasible.\n   8.2 Logs are retained for at least 365 days, with restricted access and tamper-resistant storage for critical systems, and centralization of logging; immutable storage for critical logs; SIEM correlation; time sync (NTP).\n   8.The assigned security officer reviews alerts and trends and escalates potential incidents for investigation.\n\n9. Incident Response (Administrative & Technical)\n   9.1 Suspected security incidents are reported to Security and the Privacy Officer within 48 hours of discovery.\n   9.2 The incident team performs triage, containment, eradication, and recovery, and documents lessons learned.\n   9.3 Where ePHI is involved, the Privacy Officer coordinates regulatory notifications consistent with applicable law.\n\n10. Contingency Planning & Backups (Administrative & Technical)\n   10.1 Production data is backed up regularly and encrypted in storage and transit to the backup repository.\n   10.Restore procedures are tested monthly; results and defects are tracked for 6 months; quarterly restore tests ensure accuracy; annual DR drills simulate real-world scenarios.\n   10.3 Disaster recovery objectives (RTO/RPO) are defined for critical services and validated through an annual exercise.\n\n11. Physical Safeguards\n   11.1 Facilities housing production systems use badge-controlled access and visitor sign-in procedures.\n   11.2 Workstations used to access PHI employ secure screens, privacy filters, and clear desks.\n\n12. Vendor & Third-Party Management (Organizational)\n   12.1 Vendors with access to sensitive data undergo due diligence and must meet Company security expectations.\n   12.2 Business Associate Agreements are executed before any vendor handles ePHI; subcontractors must meet equivalent obligations.\n\n13. Data Classification & Handling\n   13.1 Data is categorized (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted/ePHI). Handling rules specify storage, sharing, and disposal requirements.\n   13.2 Personnel must access only the minimum data necessary to perform assigned duties. Purpose: To ensure that personnel have access only what is required for their job functions. Physical Safeguards: Implement physical security measures such as locked cabinets and restricted areas to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n14. Secure Development & Change Management\n   14.1 Changes to production services require peer review and approval appropriate to the risk of the change.\n   14.2 Code changes are scanned for known weaknesses; high-risk issues are remediated before release or tracked with an approved exception; input validation; reconciliation; QA gates; error handling/playbacks; rollback procedures. emergency changes undergo review after implementation. integrity measures include hashing/signing where applicable; change detection; anti-tamper techniques.\n   14.3 Secrets are stored in managed vaults; direct embedding of secrets in source code is prohibited.\n\n15. Vulnerability & Patch Management\n   15.1 Systems are scanned regularly; findings are triaged and tracked to closure.\n   15.The high-risk exceptions must be approved by the executive before they can proceed beyond the initial 90-day period; otherwise, the vulnerability remains critical.\n\n16.
