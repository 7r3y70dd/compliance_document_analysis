Document Title: Company Information Security & Privacy Policy (Mid-Coverage Draft)
Effective Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>   Version: 0.9

1. Purpose
   1.1 This policy sets minimum safeguards to protect Company Data, including any electronic health information handled by <CompanyName>.
   1.2 The objectives are to prevent unauthorized access, ensure service continuity, and promote responsible handling of sensitive information.

2. Scope
   2.1 Applies to all employees, contractors, and vendors who access Company systems.
   2.2 Sections marked “ePHI” apply where electronic protected health information is processed.

3. Governance & Roles
   3.1 The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) owns this policy and leads the security program.
   3.2 The Privacy Officer oversees privacy practices and breach communications.
   3.3 System Owners approve access to their systems and complete user access reviews.
   3.4 All personnel complete training and report suspected incidents without delay.

4. Risk Management (Administrative)
   4.1 An enterprise risk analysis is performed at least annually and after major changes. Results are tracked in a risk register with owners and due dates.
   4.2 Risks rated Critical or High are remediated on a defined timetable. Risk acceptance requires written business justification and CISO approval.
   4.3 Sanctions: policy violations may lead to corrective action up to termination.

5. Access Control (Technical & Administrative)
   5.1 Access is granted based on job duties and approved by the relevant manager and System Owner (least-privilege).
   5.2 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory for administrators and remote access. (MFA for all users is recommended.)
   5.3 Sessions must lock after 20 minutes of inactivity and require re-authentication to resume.
   5.4 User access reviews are performed twice per year on high-risk systems and at least annually on others; remediation is documented.

6. Workforce Security & Training (Administrative)
   6.1 New hires complete security and privacy onboarding before system access is enabled; all personnel complete refresher training annually.
   6.2 Departing personnel have access revoked within 24 hours of separation. Company assets and credentials are returned or disabled.

7. Encryption & Key Management (Technical)
   7.1 All production databases and file stores containing sensitive data are encrypted at rest using strong, industry-accepted algorithms.
   7.2 Data in transit should use secure protocols (TLS 1.2+). Exceptions require documented risk review and compensating controls.
   7.3 Keys are generated, stored, and rotated according to internal key management procedures.

8. Logging & Monitoring (Technical)
   8.1 Security-relevant events (authentication results, privilege changes, configuration changes, and incident indicators) are logged centrally where feasible.
   8.2 Logs are retained for no less than 180 days, with restricted access and tamper-resistant storage for critical systems.
   8.3 The security team reviews alerts and trends and escalates potential incidents for investigation.

9. Incident Response (Administrative & Technical)
   9.1 Suspected security incidents are reported to Security and the Privacy Officer within 48 hours of discovery.
   9.2 The incident team performs triage, containment, eradication, and recovery, and documents lessons learned.
   9.3 Where ePHI is involved, the Privacy Officer coordinates regulatory notifications consistent with applicable law.

10. Contingency Planning & Backups (Administrative & Technical)
   10.1 Production data is backed up regularly and encrypted in storage and transit to the backup repository.
   10.2 Restore procedures are tested at least twice per year; results and defects are tracked to closure.
   10.3 Disaster recovery objectives (RTO/RPO) are defined for critical services and validated through an annual exercise.

11. Physical Safeguards
   11.1 Facilities housing production systems use badge-controlled access and visitor sign-in procedures.
   11.2 Workstations used to access sensitive data employ full-disk encryption and automatic screen locking.

12. Vendor & Third-Party Management (Organizational)
   12.1 Vendors with access to sensitive data undergo due diligence and must meet Company security expectations.
   12.2 Business Associate Agreements are executed before any vendor handles ePHI; subcontractors must meet equivalent obligations.

13. Data Classification & Handling
   13.1 Data is categorized (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted/ePHI). Handling rules specify storage, sharing, and disposal requirements.
   13.2 Personnel must access only the minimum data necessary to perform assigned duties.

14. Secure Development & Change Management
   14.1 Changes to production services require peer review and approval appropriate to the risk of the change.
   14.2 Code changes are scanned for known weaknesses; high-risk issues are remediated before release or tracked with an approved exception.
   14.3 Secrets are stored in managed vaults; direct embedding of secrets in source code is prohibited.

15. Vulnerability & Patch Management
   15.1 Systems are scanned regularly; findings are triaged and tracked to closure.
   15.2 Critical vulnerabilities are remediated within 14 days, and High within 30 days unless an approved exception exists.

16. Documentation & Retention
   16.1 Security and privacy program documentation, access review evidence, incident records, and training logs are retained for at least six (6) years from creation or last effective date.
   16.2 This policy is reviewed at least annually and upon material changes.

17. Privacy Program (Overview)
   17.1 Notices describe how personal information is collected, used, and shared; requests to access or delete personal information are honored as required by applicable law.
