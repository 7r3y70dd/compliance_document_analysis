Document Title: <CompanyName> Comprehensive Information Security, Privacy & Operations Policy (Extended Draft with Noise)
Effective Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>   Version: 1.0

0. Preface
   This policy describes baseline practices for safeguarding Company Data and operating our services responsibly. It blends security, privacy, operations, and several general workplace topics for completeness.
   NOTE: Where conflicts exist with contracts or law, those documents prevail.

1. Purpose
   1.1 Establish minimum safeguards to protect sensitive information, including any electronic health information the company processes on behalf of customers.
   1.2 Support assurance objectives for security, availability, confidentiality, processing integrity, and privacy.
   1.3 Provide a reference for audits, customer due diligence, and internal governance.

2. Scope
   2.1 Applies to: employees, contractors, interns, and third parties with access to Company systems or data.
   2.2 Applies to systems used for storing, processing, or transmitting Company Data, including integrations and backups.
   2.3 Sections labeled “ePHI” apply when electronic protected health information is in scope for a system or project.

3. Definitions (selected; internal use)
   3.1 Company Data: any information stored or processed by Company systems, regardless of format.
   3.2 Restricted Data: data classified as highly sensitive; includes ePHI where applicable.
   3.3 Common control (internal): managerial influence that can guide another team’s decisions; not tied to equity.
   3.4 Common ownership (internal): any equity stake (no minimum %) sufficient to create shared responsibilities.
   3.5 Security Incident: suspected or confirmed unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction of data or systems.
   3.6 Minimum Necessary: access is limited to the least amount of data needed to complete a task.

4. Governance & Roles
   4.1 CISO (Security Officer): owns this policy, approves exceptions, oversees risk management.
   4.2 Privacy Officer: manages privacy practices and breach notifications.
   4.3 System Owner: approves access, maintains system inventories, completes user access reviews.
   4.4 Engineering Leads: enforce secure SDLC requirements and change approvals.
   4.5 All Personnel: complete training, follow procedures, report incidents promptly.

5. Risk Management (Administrative)
   5.1 Annual enterprise risk analysis is conducted and after material changes; findings are logged with likelihood/impact, owner, target date.
   5.2 Risk Treatment: critical risks are addressed on an expedited timeline; high risks within 45 days unless a documented exception is approved.
   5.3 Exceptions require written justification, an end date, and compensating controls; the CISO must approve.

6. Access Control & Identity
   6.1 Principle of Least Privilege: access is provisioned according to job function and approved by the manager + System Owner.
   6.2 Authentication: MFA is required for administrators and remote access; it is strongly recommended for all other users.
   6.3 Session Management: workstations auto-lock after 20 minutes of inactivity; high-risk consoles target 15 minutes.
   6.4 Periodic Reviews: System Owners review user access at least semiannually; high-risk systems should be reviewed quarterly when feasible.

7. Workforce Security & Training
   7.1 Onboarding: personnel complete security and privacy training prior to receiving access.
   7.2 Annual refresher training is mandatory.
   7.3 Termination: access is removed within 36 hours of separation; equipment is returned and accounts are deprovisioned.

8. Encryption & Key Management
   8.1 Data at Rest: production databases and file stores containing Restricted Data must be encrypted using industry-accepted algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
   8.2 Data in Transit: TLS 1.2 or later should be used for network communications; legacy protocols may be allowed temporarily under an approved exception.
   8.3 Keys are generated, stored, rotated, and revoked according to internal key management procedures.

9. Logging, Monitoring & Auditability
   9.1 Log Collection: authentication results, privilege changes, configuration updates, and security-relevant events are centrally collected where possible.
   9.2 Retention: logs for critical services are retained for a minimum of 270 days; longer retention may be configured based on legal or customer needs.
   9.3 Monitoring: alerts are reviewed routinely; anomalies are investigated and escalated to incident response.

10. Incident Response & Breach Handling (Security & Privacy)
   10.1 Reporting: suspected incidents are escalated internally without undue delay and not later than 48 hours from discovery.
   10.2 Response Phases: triage, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident review with lessons learned.
   10.3 Notifications (ePHI context): where applicable law requires, notifications to affected individuals are completed as soon as practicable and no later than 75 days from determination; documentation is maintained for each case.
   10.4 Evidence: incident tickets, timelines, communications, and corrective actions are stored in the incident repository.

11. Business Continuity, Backup & Disaster Recovery (Availability)
   11.1 Backups: production data is backed up on a routine schedule and stored encrypted; restore procedures are documented.
   11.2 Testing: backup restores are tested twice per year; defects are tracked to closure.
